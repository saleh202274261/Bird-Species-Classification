Bird Species Classification

Project Description

This project is a deep learning application that classifies bird species from images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on EfficientNetB0 with transfer learning. The application includes a user-friendly GUI that allows users to upload bird images and receive accurate species predictions with confidence scores.

Key Features:

· Image preprocessing and augmentation
· Transfer learning with EfficientNetB0
· Model training with early stopping and checkpointing
· Interactive GUI for predictions
· Performance metrics visualization
